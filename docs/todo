=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item speed

Speed improvements are probably the highest priority

I wonder if AUTOLOAD routines are a benefit while they're tidy and save lots 
of drossy code, they are the slowest methods and use up the most time (%), 
even when aliased into the symbol table and primed?

=item ID

Where:

	[ID]  = new ticket id has been assigned to this message

	[ID*] = this is a reply to an existing non-open ticket

	[ID-] = this is a reply to a ticket which has been deleted or is non-existent
