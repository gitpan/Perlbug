A couple of points on the tests:
 
31_Object.t must succeed for most of the rest of the tests to stand half a chance
 
Some of these can be used specifically in the following manner, to help track down bugs:
	perl t/76_Email.t 	# run all tests in this file 
 	perl t/76_Email.t remap	# run only the remap tests

Test sequence should look like this:
