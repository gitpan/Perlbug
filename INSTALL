LONG:
   
    See below:

PREREQUISITES:

    Perl :-)
    
    MySQL installation from TCX
    
    DBI::* suite from Tim Bunce 
	
    Mail::* suite from GBarr

    
INSTALLATION:

    Unpack the distribution in a suitable base level Perlbug directory.
	
	The only files you should _need_ to edit are in the B<config> directory, 
	though you will probably choose to modify the B<site> files too.
	
	Install suitable SQL database(currenly only Mysql supported, Oracle on the 
	todo list), (make sure you can access the database with the parameters you 
	give to the config/Configuration file).
	
	Run the scripts in the sql directory to create all the tables etc. 
	in the database:
		mysql -p < sql/create_perlbug.sql		
		mysql -p perlbug < sql/create_tables.sql
		mysql -p perlbug < sql/insert_flags.sql
		mysql -p perlbug < sql/insert_admin.sql # perhaps?
	
	Set the enviroment variable Perlbug_Config=/path/to/config/Configuration,
	and set it in Perlbug/Config.pm to be sure.
	
	Configure the ./config/Configuration file which should be fairly 
	self-explanatory, but in particular ensure that:
	
		system::user is a real user on your system
	
		system::dirs spool/(logs & ranges & results & temp) 
		exist and are writable by the system user.
		
		database(username & password) are correct
	
	Modify config/Matches to map patterns to targets categories/status, 
	if the defaults are not suitable.
	
	Setup mail forwarding to the appropriate scripts:
	
	    slurping the data:               tron.pl (email or mailing lists)
	    
	    query the data, admin interface: mail.pl (email)
	
	Setup a cron job for regular tasks, clean up:
	
	    every week: 		cron.cmd
        
	Ensure perlbug.cgi is executable by the webserver.
	
	You'll also want to modify the config/.htpasswd web/.htaccess entries to 
	enable the administration side of things via www. 
	
	Create admins via the admins page at your config::web::domain
		http://your.web.server/admin/perlbug.cgi?req=administrators page
	
		or directly utilise the tm_users inserts in t/00_Test.t

	For the default source and database data downloads to be operational 
	links or files will need to be installed from archive to web/archive 
	and web/admin/archive
	
	Voila! (hopefully :-)
	
	

COMMENTS:
	
	The spool (logs, results, ranges, temp) directories are all initially 
	installed under the Perlbug root.  These directories are liable to fill 
	up with volatile data and are prime candidates for moving to another area 
	(eg: /tmp/*), or disposing of periodically (eg: via cron). 
	Remember to reflect changes in the Configuration file.

	Any stray test ticket data inserted in the database by 'make test' that 
	remains from an incomplete test run should be removed by t/99_Test.t
