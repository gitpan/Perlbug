PREREQUISITES:

	Perl :-)

	MySQL installation from TCX

	URI-1.09 or up from Gisle Aas

	HTML-Parser-3.03 or up originaly from Gisle Aas

	MailTools-1.13 or up from GBarr

	Complete list of prerequisites in Makefile.PL

    
INSTALLATION:

    Unpack the distribution in a suitable base level Perlbug directory.

	Although it is recommended to create an appropriate system user,
	'perlbug' for example, this is not necessary.  However all file 
	and directory paths in these instructions will assume we are using 
	a dedicated 'perlbug' user account, and will be relative to his/her home.

	In the slim chance that everything appears to be in a ~perlbug/perlbug
	directory, stick it all in ~perlbug directly.  ie; ~perlbug/Makefile.PL, 
	~perlbug/Perlbug, ~perlbug/Perlbug.pm, ~perlbug/sql, ~perlbug/web, etc.
		
	The only files you should _need_ to edit are in the ~/config directory, 
	though, if using this application 'in anger', you will probably choose 
	to modify the ~/site files too.
	
	Install suitable SQL database(currenly only Mysql supported, Oracle is 
	on the todo list), (make sure you can access the database with the 
	parameters you give to the ~/config/Configuration file).
	
	Run the scripts in the appropriate ~/sql/* directories to create the 
	database, the default database user, all the tables, inserting some 
	minimal default entries etc.  In particular, follow the instructions 
	in ~/sql/README

	Set the Configuration file location in ~/Perlbug/Config.pm, this can 
	also be set 'on the fly' in the environment for testing, eg:

		export Perlbug_Config=~/mytest/Configuration

	Configure the ~/config/Configuration file which should be fairly 
	self-explanatory, but in particular ensure that:
	
		database(username & password) are correct
		
		directory entries all point to the correct locations
		
		system::user is a real user on your system
	
		directory::arch, spool(logs & temp) etc. 
		all exist and are writable by the appropriate user/s. 
		eg:
			
			mkdir -p ~/perlbug/spool/archive 
			mkdir -p ~/perlbug/spool/logs 
			# etc. 

			chmod -R 777 ~/perlbug/spool
	
	Setup mail forwarding to the appropriate scripts:
	
	    slurping the data:               ~/scripts/bugtron (email/mailing lists)
	    
	    query the data, admin interface: ~/scripts/bugmail (email)
	
	Setup a cron job for regular tasks, clean up:
	
	    every week:                      ~/scripts/bugcron
        
	Ensure ~/scripts/perlbug.cgi is executable by the webserver.
	
	You'll also want to modify the ~/config/.htpasswd and ~/web/.htaccess entries 
	to enable the administration side of things via www, unless you're using 
	this in system::restricted=0 mode. 
	
	Create admins via the admins page at your config::web::domain
		http://your.web.server/admin/perlbug.cgi?req=administrators page
	
		or adapt the ~/sql/generic/create_admin.sql script

	For the default source and database data downloads to be operational 
	links or files will probably need to be installed from archive to 
	~/web/archive and ~/web/admin/archive
	
	Voila! (hopefully :-)
	
	

COMMENTS:
	
	The ~/spool(archive, logs, results, ranges, temp) directories are all 
	initially installed under the Perlbug root.  These directories are liable 
	to fill up with volatile data and are prime candidates for moving to 
	another area (eg: /tmp/*), or disposing of periodically (eg: via cron). 
	Remember to reflect changes in the ~/config/Configuration file.

	Any stray test bug data inserted in the database by 'make test' that 
	remains from an incomplete test run should be removed by ~/t/99_Test.t
